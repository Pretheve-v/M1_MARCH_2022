Pacman Game in C is a simple console application or a mini clip game designed for the purpose of entertainment. It resembles the snake game to some extent in which the Pacman should be driven in such a way that it moves along the predefined blue path so that the path is erased or eaten by Pacman. More you erase the path, more score you gain. The game is easy to play. Here, I have presented the source code for this project.
The source code of the Pacman Game in C has been written in C programming language and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in which the project was developed is Code::Blocks using GCC compiler.
The user defined header file created in the source code of the game is header.h. The C files of the game are for controlling the motion & direction of Pacman as well as to create the path. Pacman Game in C gives the clear concept of use of file handling, the use of user defined header files, combination of number of C files in a single project etc.
